This app comes from the FAMEST project in order to help vizualize data from 2 sensorized insoles. Capable of dual Bluetooth connection and saving data into phone's internal memory

I have yet to clean up the code as there are a lot of repetitive lines... Unfortunately the company I work for doesn't care about that, so I wasn't given the time I needed to clean it up.

Right now the Sensors and DrawerActivity classes are not being called but they could be in further developments
